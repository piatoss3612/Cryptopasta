## World Building

Cryptopasta is an organization dedicated to uncovering the truth behind urban legends that circulate on the blockchain. These legends were once dismissed as mere folklore, but under mysterious conditions, strange entities from these stories began to manifest within the blockchain network.

These manifested entities started consuming resources within the blockchain, eventually causing disruptions and creating voids known as Voidlinks. These Voidlinks are rifts between blockchain layers or between different chains, through which they began siphoning off funds and assets.

In response to this threat, a group of dedicated individuals formed Cryptopasta. The organizationâ€™s mission is to investigate these urban legends, confront the entities that have taken form, and protect the integrity of the blockchain world.

You are an agent of Cryptopasta. As part of this organization, you will embark on adventures to explore the blockchain-derived urban legends and safeguard this digital realm.
