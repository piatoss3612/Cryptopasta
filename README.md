# Cryptopasta

A social dapp for learning blockchain security powered by blockchain and AI.

## Inspiration

Inspired by [heart moving words](https://x.com/PatrickAlphaC/status/1785326601061687545), I also believe that every user interacting with smart contract should have some degree of understanding about the security on the blockchain to protect themselves from potential threats. So, I decided to build a platform that can help dapp users to learn blockchain security.

There are some dapps for learning blockchain security, such as `Ethernaut`, `CryptoZombies` and `Capture the Ether`. To interact with these dapps, users need to have some programming knowledge like JavaScript, Solidity, etc. But what if users don't have any programming knowledge and don't want to be complicated? How can we help them to learn blockchain security in a more fun and engaging way?

I think the key is to **simplify** the learning process. Instead of learning the **details** of the security issue, what if we only remember the **context** of the security issue? For example, if we only remember the context of the reentrancy attack, we can still have a general understanding of the security issue, and we can search for the details when we need them. Also with context, we can process it in a more fun and engaging way like storytelling through text-based adventure game, which can help users to remember the context better.

## What it does

Cryptopasta is a social dapp that allows users to learn blockchain security in a fun and engaging way. Users become an agent of the fictional organization called `Cryptopasta` inspired by the `Creepypasta` and `SCP Foundation`. The organization is responsible for discovering and isolating the threats on the blockchain world.

What users can do in Cryptopasta:

1. Register an account and become an agent of Cryptopasta.
2. Create discovery report about Cryptopasta and submit it to the organization.
3. According to the reports, the agent takes the mission to isolate the threats through text-based adventure game powered by AI.
4. Rate the reports or fund the agents to keep their creative work.
5. Share the results of the mission as a NFT on social media and show off to friends.
