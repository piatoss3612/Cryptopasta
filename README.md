## Introduction

Cryptopasta is a text-based adventure game powered by blockchain and AI. The game is set in a world where the blockchain ecosystem is threatened by a mysterious void called **Voidlink**. Players take on the role of an agent of **Cryptopasta**, a decentralized organization tasked with exploring Voidlink, confronting the enigmatic presence known as **Null**, and securing the blockchain world. This game is designed to be an security awareness training tool for anyone interested in blockchain. Players will learn about the security risks in the blockchain world and how to protect themselves from these threats in a fun and engaging way.

## Inspiration

I believe that every user interacting with dapps or smart contracts should have some degree of understanding about the security on the blockchain to protect themselves from potential threats.

Currently, there are dapps like `Ethernaut`, `CryptoZombies`, and `Capture the Ether` designed to teach blockchain security. However, these dapps require users to have some programming knowledge, such as JavaScript and Solidity. But what about users who lack programming skills and prefer a simpler approach? How can we help them learn blockchain security in a more fun and engaging way?

The key is to simplify the learning process. Instead of focusing on the intricate details of each security issue, what if we emphasize understanding the context of these issues? For instance, by grasping the context of a reentrancy attack, users can gain a general understanding of the security problem and look up the specifics when necessary. By presenting this context through storytelling and text-based adventure games, we can make the learning process more enjoyable and memorable.

This approach not only makes blockchain security accessible to everyone but also ensures that users can protect themselves without needing in-depth technical knowledge.

## Prologue

One day, an incident occurred where some assets and data being transferred between chains through a bridge protocol mysteriously vanished. Initially dismissed as a simple mishap, similar incidents began to occur in other projects, plunging the blockchain world into chaos.

Then, an anonymous figure disclosed information about the phenomenon. No one knew who this person was, but their information sent shockwaves through the blockchain community.

At the center of this phenomenon was a space known as **Voidlink**. Voidlink is an enigmatic void existing between the layers of blockchains and between chains. No one knows why this space was created, but as long as it exists, the blockchain world remains exposed to danger. Rumors also spread about a presence in this space, representing projects that were shut down or disappeared due to past security issues. This presence is called **Null** and is said to have the ability to nullify data.

To combat this threat, a decentralized organization called **Cryptopasta** was formed. Cryptopasta's mission is to enter Voidlink, recover the lost assets and data, and investigate how to close this space.

You are an agent of Cryptopasta, tasked with exploring the secretive Voidlink, confronting Null, and carrying out the mission to secure the blockchain world. Your courage and wisdom will determine the success of Cryptopasta and the safety of the blockchain ecosystem.
